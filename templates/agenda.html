Does someone you know? Knowing this information is vital—both for your career and your personal life. After all, am I the only one around here who wants to avoid Angry Walter? And who *wouldn't* want to work with Success Kid.\r\n\r\nBut can we even find out if we have a meme twin? There are lots of memes. And lots of people. How could we possibly search them all? Well, it's easier than you think if we turn those memes into embeddings and search them with a vector database!\r\n\r\nBut what's an embedding? And what's a vector database? I'll begin by exploring embeddings, showing how unstructured data, such as text and images, can be translated into hyper-dimensional arrays—called vectors. Then I'll talk about vector databases, covering what they are and how you can use them to store and search those embeddings with embeddings of your own.\r\n\r\nOf course, we'll do this all by example. I've turned all the big memes—from Ancient Aliens Guy to Zombie Boy—into embeddings and have loaded them into a vector database. I've built an application around these embeddings and that database. I'll show you the code and the queries of this application so that you can build something similar for yourself. And, most importantly, we'll take some photos during the session and use it all to find your meme twin!\r\n\r\nSo, are you ready to find your meme twin?

The basic ergonomics and architecture of graph computing is shifting, so the solution is less clear.\n\nThis talk goes into the design and early usage patterns of GFQL, the first open source dataframe-native graph query language, built for massive scale and seamless Python integration and representative of these changing ideas. We’ll show how GFQL harnesses GPU acceleration to achieve up to 42X speedups on real-world graphs, and how its underlying components have won third place in the Graph 500 on its first submission. We’ll dive into how we have been using it on projects spanning billion-dollar lawsuits, cybersecurity incident response, clickstream analytics, and mining the Bluesky firehose in real-time. We’ll also see how GFQL avoids the overhead of external graph databases—no new infrastructure to manage—so we can work directly from our Jupyter notebooks, Python dashboards, and web apps from a simple pip install. Finally, learn how to combine GFQL with PyData, Arrow, and GPU libraries for end-to-end graph analytics, from data loading to interactive visualization and AI."}],"_type":"block","style":"normal"}]}},{"_id":"763569","firstDay":{"day":"Thursday","date":"2025-05-22"},"days":[{"day":"Thursday","date":"2025-05-22"}],"startDate":"2025-05-22","title":"15 years of insights from a TDD practitioner","slotType":"talk","length":{"id":"GgnlPDq-43xSXWH6fJju-","type":"Talk","title":"Talk (60 min)"},"room":"Room 1","isRemote":false,"slug":"15-years-of-insights-from-a-tdd-practitioner-0d5f","conferenceRef":"efb57dc5-6e81-4a2c-91a0-753078a8cbbd","hourRange":"15:00 - 16:00","scheduleKey":"0q4mwdqabt8","topics":[{"_id":"11233be8-e7aa-40b5-b7fd-17a597e32130","title":"TDD"},{"_id":"101230","title":".NET"}],"tags":[],"speakers":[{"_id":"ab01a796-ecbb-4d51-ba4a-cdd8b86ea6a7","firstName":"Dennis","lastName":"Doomen","position":"Hands-on architect in the .NET space with 27 years of experience on an everlasting quest for knowledge to build the right software the right way at the right time","twitterUrl":"https://twitter.com/ddoomen","twitterName":"@ddoomen","description":{"en":[{"_key":"ab01a796-ecbb-4d51-ba4a-cdd8b86ea6a7_0oepzp70405_block","markDefs":[],"children":[{"marks":[],"text":"Dennis is a Microsoft MVP and Principal Consultant at Dutch Microsoft consultancy firm Aviva Solutions.

But what does autonomy truly mean in practice, and how can it deliver measurable value? Is it the key to success, or just another management headache?\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll demystify autonomy and self-organisation, exploring their real-world applications and benefits. You’ll gain the clarity and confidence to explain how autonomous teams function effectively in organisations, and you’ll be armed with arguments to steer endless autonomy debates back toward what really matters—creating value that drives your organisation forward.\r\n\r\nBeyond the theory, we’ll dive into practical insights, addressing common challenges and questions drawn from years of client work and training sessions.

How does it work and is it safer than your standard passwords and other MFAs like time-based one-time passwords? Even passwords we consider safe due to length and entropy are a risk factor. The talk will give quick real-life coverage of how no password is truly safer. It will go through what FIDO2 is, details on the CTAP2 and Webauthn specifications that FIDO2 encompasses, including covering what passkeys are.\nAt the end you should know what options you have right now as an end user to start going passwordless, and what you as a developer can do to help secure others.\n","_key":"db18e5f12cb6"}],"_type":"block","style":"normal"}]}},{"_id":"842261","firstDay":{"day":"Friday","date":"2025-05-23"},"days":[{"day":"Friday","date":"2025-05-23"}],"startDate":"2025-05-23","title":"Lightning Talks 6","slotType":"talk","length":{"id":"llVCgjAnYo0ekaQNhpUs9","type":"Talk","title":"Talk (60 min)"},"room":"Room 6","isRemote":false,"slug":"lightning-talks-6-0jgt","conferenceRef":"efb57dc5-6e81-4a2c-91a0-753078a8cbbd","hourRange":"15:00 - 16:00","scheduleKey":"0kioma7z8s7","topics":[{"_id":"101260","title":"Soft Skills"},{"_id":"103703","title":"Work skills"},{"_id":"101231","title":"Agile"},{"title":"Mobile","_id":"101256"},{"_id":"101245","title":"Ethics"},{"title":"People","_id":"101257"},{"_id":"101246","title":"Fun"},{"title":"Tools","_id":"101262"}],"tags":[],"speakers":[{"_id":"a5453f13-cd2d-4f1f-959b-b138efb3f389","firstName":"Elin","lastName":"Brusberg","position":"Software development manager at Vitec Megler","twitterUrl":"","twitterName":"","description":{"en":[{"children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"About me:\r\nWorked as a developer for many years, but sadly not a lot of time left for coding now.\r\nI spend most of my days supporting the team and working long term on our technical and resource strategy.\r\nOn occasions lucky to share my experience with a wider audience, such as this.\r\n","_key":"a5453f13-cd2d-4f1f-959b-b138efb3f389_0p36m0c71j5_span"}],"_type":"block","style":"normal","_key":"a5453f13-cd2d-4f1f-959b-b138efb3f389_0yjyxtz8gqh_block","markDefs":[]}]},"slug":"elin-brusberg","imageThumbnail":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/fhoo4r9z/production/8bf5e047d9983c01f07e0812c7aacbaeade85c1d-400x400.jpg?w=60\u0026h=60","imageBase64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","imageUrl":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/fhoo4r9z/production/8bf5e047d9983c01f07e0812c7aacbaeade85c1d-400x400.jpg?w=285\u0026h=285\u0026q=85\u0026auto=format"},{"_id":"ecf200a5-4fb4-4514-b4f3-20c6ddf538c8","firstName":"Bodil","lastName":"Ibrahim","position":"Chief Product Owner, Trumf","twitterUrl":"","twitterName":"","description":{"en":[{"children":[{"marks":[],"text":"Bodil Ibrahim has extensive experience with the development of the Trumf loyalty program and held the role of Product Owner for Trumf Pay during the development and launch of the mobile payment solution.
